# Fixed Bugs

## Players.map is not a function
✅ FIXED: TypeError: players.map is not a function
  - Issue occurred in ProjectionAdjuster component where players variable wasn't consistently an array
  - Root cause: The API endpoint `/players` returns a paginated response structure `{ players: [...], pagination: {...} }`, but component expected players to be an array directly
  - Fix: 
    1. Enhanced PlayerService.getPlayers to handle error cases and return consistent response format
    2. Updated ProjectionAdjuster component to properly handle the response structure 
    3. Added more robust Array.isArray() checks and player object validation
    4. Added better error logging to diagnose future issues
  - Implemented an ErrorBoundary component for better error handling

## Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toFixed')
✅ FIXED: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toFixed')
  - Issue occurred in formatter functions in types/index.ts when null values were passed to toFixed()
  - Root cause: Some stats in the projection data could be null or undefined, but the formatters were calling toFixed() directly without checking
  - Fix:
    1. Added null/undefined checks in all formatter functions in STAT_FORMATS
    2. Added default values when null/undefined are encountered
    3. Enhanced ProjectionRangeChart to handle null/undefined values safely
    4. Added defensive checks throughout data visualization components
  - This ensures safe handling of incomplete data and prevents runtime errors

## Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toString')
✅ FIXED: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'toString')
  - Issue occurred in the ProjectionAdjuster component's override display and the stat comparison sections
  - Root cause: In multiple places, the code was directly accessing values that could be null/undefined without proper checks
  - Fix:
    1. Updated override formatValue function to safely handle null values
    2. Added null checks in percentChange helper function
    3. Added default fallback values (|| 0) to all projection property accesses
    4. Improved baseValue and currentValue handling in generateComparisonData
    5. Added null-safe comparisons in multiple UI display sections
  - These changes ensure consistent behavior even with incomplete or missing stat values

## Additional Array.isArray and null checks
✅ FIXED: Persistent null value and array issues in overrides section
  - Issue: Despite earlier fixes, still encountering null errors in the overrides section
  - Root cause: The overrides array itself could be null/undefined in some cases, and there were instances where individual override objects might be invalid
  - Fix:
    1. Added checks to verify that overrides is a valid array before calling .map()
    2. Added validation for each override object to ensure it's a valid object before accessing properties
    3. Added null/undefined checks on individual override properties with fallbacks
    4. Enhanced error handling in the OverrideService to return empty arrays for failed fetches 
    5. Added defensive fallbacks for all field accesses in the overrides table
    6. Made the Remove button conditionally disabled when override_id is missing
  - This improves the robustness of the component when dealing with incomplete or unexpected data from the API

## Position-specific stat null values
✅ FIXED: TypeError issues with QB and RB players
  - Issue: While WR and TE players were working fine, QB and RB players were still throwing errors
  - Root cause: Several null-handling issues in position-specific stats for QB and RB players:
    1. The color functions in STAT_FORMATS were not checking for null values before using comparison operators
    2. QB and RB positions access different stat fields than WR/TE, some of which may be null in the database
  - Fix:
    1. Added null checks to ALL color functions in STAT_FORMATS with default color fallbacks
    2. Updated QB-specific stats (comp_pct, yards_per_att, pass_td_rate, int_rate) with null safety
    3. Updated RB-specific stats (yards_per_carry) with null safety
    4. Added extra null check in the comparison data generation for key stats
  - This ensures consistent display handling for all player positions, even when stats are missing

## Additional Missing Null Checks
✅ FIXED: Remaining toString null errors in detailed stats view
  - Issue: Stats details view was still throwing errors for newly created projections
  - Root cause: The baseValue and currentValue were still being accessed directly when null in some cases
  - Fix:
    1. Added null/undefined checks and default values to baseValue and currentValue in the detailed stats view
    2. Enhanced className condition to check for null/undefined before trying to use color functions
    3. Added safer string conversion by adding additional safety checks
    4. Verified that these changes handle the edge case of newly created projections with incomplete stats
  - This ensures the stat details view can safely display incomplete or missing stat values

## TeamAdjuster Component Errors
✅ FIXED: TypeError: teamPlayers.reduce is not a function
  - Issue occurred in TeamAdjuster component where teamPlayers wasn't being properly extracted from the API response
  - Root cause: The API endpoint `/players?team=xxx` returns a paginated response structure `{ players: [...], pagination: {...} }`, but component was treating it as an array directly
  - Fix:
    1. Updated PlayerService response handling to extract the players array from the response structure
    2. Added multiple Array.isArray() checks to ensure array methods are only called on actual arrays
    3. Added comprehensive null checks throughout the component
    4. Added fallback values for all data accesses that might be null/undefined
    5. Enhanced player and projection validation to catch edge cases
  - These changes make the TeamAdjuster component much more robust against unexpected data shapes and null values

## Dashboard Missing getPlayersOverview Method
✅ FIXED: TypeError: PlayerService.getPlayersOverview is not a function
  - Issue occurred in the DashboardPage component where it was calling a nonexistent method `PlayerService.getPlayersOverview()`
  - Root cause: The method was referenced in the component but had never been implemented in the PlayerService
  - Fix:
    1. Implemented the missing `getPlayersOverview()` method in PlayerService that properly extracts player arrays from the response
    2. Added comprehensive null checks and fallbacks in the DashboardPage to handle potential null/undefined values
    3. Enhanced array checking with Array.isArray() where arrays are being processed
    4. Added missing import for ArrowsRightLeftIcon that was referenced but not imported
    5. Added additional defensive code to safely handle API response data
  - These changes make the Dashboard component much more resilient against null/undefined values and unexpected data structures

## Missing ArrowsRightLeftIcon in Dashboard
✅ FIXED: Uncaught ReferenceError: ArrowsRightLeftIcon is not defined
  - Issue occurred in the DashboardPage component where it was trying to use an undefined icon
  - Root cause: Despite being imported, the ArrowsRightLeftIcon wasn't properly available, suggesting possible versioning issues with the heroicons library
  - Fix:
    1. Replaced ArrowsRightLeftIcon with ArrowRightIcon which is known to be available
    2. Removed the unnecessary import that was causing conflicts
    3. Added extra debug logging to the getPlayersOverview method to track response data
  - This ensures the Dashboard component renders properly even if specific icons from the library aren't available

## Added "Run Projections" Functionality
✅ FIXED: Dashboard showed "No projections found in the baseline scenario" but didn't provide a way to run projections
  - Issue: Dashboard showed informative message about missing projections, but the "New Projection" button didn't do anything
  - Root cause: The "New Projection" button in the header only redirected to the scenarios page without creating projections, and there was no easy way for users to generate projections for all players
  - Fix:
    1. Added a "Run Projections" button to the Dashboard header that calls the createBaseProjection endpoint
    2. Implemented a batch processing approach that creates projections for all players in the selected scenario
    3. Added progress indicators and toast notifications to inform users about the projection generation process
    4. Updated page reload functionality to show new projections immediately after creation
    5. Renamed the top navigation "New Projection" button to "New Scenario" for clarity and redirected it to the Scenarios page
  - Users can now easily create projections for all players directly from the Dashboard UI

## Dashboard Empty Projections
✅ FIXED: Empty "Top Players" sections on Dashboard when no projections exist
  - Issue: Dashboard was showing "N/A" for "Top QB" and "Top RB" fields and no players were shown in the position tabs
  - Root cause: The application didn't have any projections in the baseline scenario, resulting in empty arrays from the API
  - Fix:
    1. Added comprehensive logging throughout the projection fetching process
    2. Added additional null/undefined checks to handle empty arrays safely
    3. Added informative alert messages when no baseline scenario or no projections are found
    4. Added graceful fallbacks when projection data isn't available
    5. Fixed UI to properly handle the empty state and show informative messages
  - The Dashboard now shows a clear explanation when no projections are available, guiding users to create projections

## Fixed Season Year Parameter for Projections
✅ FIXED: Projection creation was failing when using the Run Projections button
  - Issue: Clicking "Run Projections" started the process but no projections were created
  - Root cause: We were using the current year (2025) as the season parameter, but the API expects a valid season year >= 2023
  - Fix:
    1. Updated the hardcoded season year to 2023 to match API requirements
    2. Added toast notifications to keep the user informed during the process
    3. Reduced batch size from 10 to 5 players to prevent overwhelming the API
    4. Added a small delay between batches for better stability
    5. Added improved error handling and logging
    6. Enhanced progress reporting to console
  - Users can now successfully generate projections for all players from the Dashboard
