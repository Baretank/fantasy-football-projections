# Theme Updates

## Modern Dark Theme Implementation

A modern, eye-friendly dark theme has been implemented for the Fantasy Football Projections app. This theme is now the default, with the ability to toggle between light and dark modes.

### Changes Made:

1. **Color Scheme Updates**:
   - Changed default theme from bright white to a modern dark theme with softer colors
   - Updated the HSL color variables in `style.css` to use darker background colors
   - Adjusted text colors for better contrast and readability
   - Softer blues and accent colors to reduce eye strain

2. **Position Color Updates**:
   - Updated position indicator colors (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DST) to be more harmonious with the dark theme
   - Used deeper, richer colors with better contrast

3. **Theme Toggle**:
   - Added a theme toggle component (`ThemeToggle.tsx`)
   - Implemented in the app header next to the notification icon
   - Persists theme preference in localStorage
   - Respects system color scheme preference
   - Includes visual feedback when toggling themes
   - Added icon color to indicate current theme state

4. **Default Configuration**:
   - Set dark theme as default
   - Added proper dark mode configuration in Tailwind
   - Updated HTML meta tags to indicate dark color scheme preference
   - Added anti-flash script to prevent theme flicker on page load

### Benefits:

- Reduced eye strain during extended use
- Modern aesthetic with improved visual hierarchy
- Better night-time usability
- Consistent with current UI/UX best practices
- Improved readability for statistical data
- Smooth transitions between themes

### Technical Implementation:

The implementation uses CSS variables with HSL colors via Tailwind CSS, making future adjustments simple.
Dark mode is implemented via the `.dark` class on the `<html>` element and configured in Tailwind.

### Bug Fixes:

- Fixed issue with theme toggle not working properly 
- Corrected the Tailwind dark mode configuration
- Added proper theme initialization in multiple places to ensure consistent behavior:
  1. Inline script in HTML head to prevent theme flash
  2. Comprehensive theme initialization in main.tsx
  3. Improved theme detection logic in the ThemeToggle component
- Fixed compatibility with system preferences and localStorage persistence
