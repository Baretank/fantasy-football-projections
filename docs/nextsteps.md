Fantasy Football Projections System Review
After reviewing your repository, I can see you've made solid progress on the fantasy football projections system, with a comprehensive backend and initial frontend components. Here's my analysis and recommended next steps:
Current Progress
Strong Foundation

The backend architecture is well-structured with clear separation of concerns
Robust database models with detailed relationships (Player, BaseStat, TeamStat, Projection, etc.)
Comprehensive services handling projection calculations, overrides, and scenarios
Well-defined API endpoints with proper documentation
Good test infrastructure with unit, integration, and system tests

Areas for Development

Frontend implementation is still in early stages
Data flows between components need more work
UI for projection adjustments and scenario comparisons is incomplete
API integration with the frontend needs development

Recommended Next Steps
1. Complete Core Frontend Components
Build out the essential React components:
typescriptCopy// Priority frontend components to develop
- PlayerSelector (expand the existing stub)
- ProjectionEditor (for adjusting individual metrics)
- ScenarioManager (create/clone/compare scenarios)
- TeamAdjuster (for team-level adjustments)
- Dashboard (overview of current projections)
2. Implement API Client Services
Create frontend services to communicate with the backend:
typescriptCopy// src/services/api.ts
export class ProjectionService {
  async getPlayerProjections(playerId: string): Promise<Projection[]> {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/projections/player/${playerId}`);
    return response.json();
  }
  
  async updateProjection(projectionId: string, adjustments: any): Promise<Projection> {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/projections/${projectionId}`, {
      method: 'PUT',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ adjustments })
    });
    return response.json();
  }

  // Additional methods for scenarios, overrides, etc.
}
3. Enhance Data Visualization
The StatsDisplay component needs expansion:
typescriptCopy// Enhance statsdisplay.tsx with:
- Projection comparison charts
- Trend analysis visualizations
- Position-specific stat displays
- Team context visualizations
4. Implement State Management
Consider implementing context or a state management solution:
typescriptCopy// src/contexts/ProjectionContext.tsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const ProjectionContext = createContext(null);

export const ProjectionProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [currentScenario, setCurrentScenario] = useState(null);
  const [selectedPlayer, setSelectedPlayer] = useState(null);
  const [projections, setProjections] = useState([]);
  
  // Methods for managing projections, scenarios, etc.
  
  return (
    <ProjectionContext.Provider value={{
      currentScenario,
      selectedPlayer,
      projections,
      setCurrentScenario,
      setSelectedPlayer,
      // Other methods
    }}>
      {children}
    </ProjectionContext.Provider>
  );
};
5. Complete Core Functionality Loops
Focus on implementing these primary user workflows:

Select player → View projections → Make adjustments → View impact
Create scenario → Clone scenario → Compare scenarios
Team-level adjustments → View impact on all affected players
Import season data → Generate base projections → Apply overrides

6. Backend Refinements

Enhance error handling in services
Add validation for API inputs
Implement transaction handling for complex operations
Complete the "fill player" system for team stat consistency

7. Testing Expansion

Create frontend tests for components
Expand integration tests for complete workflows
Add end-to-end tests for critical user paths

Technical Considerations

Data Consistency: The projection recalculation logic in override_service.py is critical - ensure dependent stats remain mathematically consistent.
Performance: Consider optimizing database queries and adding pagination for player lists.
UI/UX: Focus on making adjustment interfaces intuitive with immediate visual feedback.
Data Import: Complete the data import pipelines for historical stats.

Implementation Strategy

Start with the core projection adjustment workflow
Build out scenario management next
Implement team-level adjustments
Add data import/export features
Enhance visualization and analysis tools
