## Status Codes

- 200: Success
- 201: Created
- 204: No Content (successful deletion)
- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Not Found
- 422: Unprocessable Entity
- 500: Internal Server Error

## Error Handling

### Error Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and includes detailed error messages in the response:

- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input parameters or request body
- `404 Not Found`: Requested resource does not exist
- `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Request validation failed
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side error

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "detail": "Detailed error message",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "fields": {
    "field_name": "Field-specific error message"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Request Rate

While there are currently no rate limits, clients should:
- Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
- Cache responses when appropriate
- Batch requests when possible

### Data Validation

Before submitting:
- Ensure all required fields are provided
- Validate data types match the schema
- Check value ranges for numerical fields

### Response Handling

Clients should:
- Handle all possible HTTP status codes
- Parse error responses for detailed messages
- Implement proper error recovery

## Pagination

For endpoints returning lists, the API supports pagination using:

Query Parameters:
- `skip`: Number of items to skip (default: 0)
- `limit`: Maximum number of items to return (default: 100, max: 1000)

Response Headers:
- `X-Total-Count`: Total number of items
- `X-Page-Count`: Total number of pages
- `X-Current-Page`: Current page number

Example:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/players?skip=20&limit=10"
```

## Caching

The API supports ETag-based caching. Clients should:
- Store the ETag header from responses
- Include If-None-Match header in subsequent requests
- Handle 304 Not Modified responses appropriately

## Versioning

The API version is included in the response headers:
- `X-API-Version`: Current API version

Future breaking changes will be introduced with a new major version number in the URL:
```
/api/v2/players
```

## Security Recommendations

While authentication is not currently required, clients should:
- Use HTTPS for all requests
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Implement request timeouts
- Monitor for suspicious activity
