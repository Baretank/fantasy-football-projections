## Database Population Progress

The database population system has been successfully implemented and all phases are now complete. Key components:

- Enhanced `NFLDataImportService`:
  - ✅ Added `limit` parameter to `import_players()` for testing with small batches
  - ✅ Added `player_limit` parameter to `import_weekly_stats()` for limited imports
  - ✅ Added improved error logging with stack traces
  - ✅ Added commit batching to avoid memory issues with large datasets

- Updated/Added scripts:
  - ✅ Added `--limit` parameter to `import_nfl_data.py` for testing with small player batches
  - ✅ Added `check_import.py` for verifying database contents after import
  - ✅ Added `create_baseline_scenario.py` for setting up projection scenarios
  - ✅ Created `import_by_position.py` for position-by-position imports to manage memory usage

- Database adaptations:
  - ✅ Fixed NFL API data field mapping issues
  - ✅ Added team data integration using team descriptions
  - ✅ Added scenario model with parameters field
  - ✅ Fixed NULL constraint issue for player status field

### Current Database State
- Total players in database: 20,758
- Players with game statistics: 562
  - QB: 79 players
  - RB: 135 players
  - WR: 228 players
  - TE: 120 players
- Teams with statistics: 36
- Scenarios created: 4 baseline scenarios

### Database Usage Commands

#### Import Data
```bash
# Position-by-position import (recommended for resource management)
python backend/scripts/import_by_position.py --season 2024 --position team
python backend/scripts/import_by_position.py --season 2024 --position QB
python backend/scripts/import_by_position.py --season 2024 --position RB
python backend/scripts/import_by_position.py --season 2024 --position WR
python backend/scripts/import_by_position.py --season 2024 --position TE

# Alternative: Import all positions with one command (still done sequentially)
python backend/scripts/import_by_position.py --season 2024 --position all

# Full import at once (can be memory intensive)
python backend/scripts/import_nfl_data.py --seasons 2024 --type full
```

#### Check Database State
```bash
# Basic check
python backend/scripts/check_import.py

# Check with filters
python backend/scripts/check_import.py --position QB --season 2024

# Check specific player
python backend/scripts/check_import.py --player "Patrick Mahomes"

# Show import logs
python backend/scripts/check_import.py --logs
```

#### Create and Manage Scenarios
```bash
# Create all scenario types
python backend/scripts/create_baseline_scenario.py --season 2024 --type all

# Create only specific scenario type
python backend/scripts/create_baseline_scenario.py --season 2024 --type team
```

## Field Standardization Update

We've converted the codebase to consistently use `rush_attempts` instead of `carries` throughout, which resulted in many test failures. Progress so far:

1. **System Tests**: 100% passing (63/63)
   - Fixed all issues in test_export_processes.py
   - All system tests are now working properly

2. **Integration Tests**: 100% passing (46/46) ✅
   - ✅ Successfully fixed player_import_integration.py tests (8/8 passing)
   - ✅ Successfully fixed rookie_veteran_integration.py tests (7/7 passing)
   - ✅ Successfully fixed projection_pipeline.py integration tests (9/9 passing)
   - ✅ Successfully fixed NFL data integration tests (2/2 passing)
   - ✅ Updated all test data files with proper field names (rush_attempts instead of carries)
   - ✅ Ensured test fixtures include all necessary fields for assertions

3. **Unit Tests**: 100% passing (142/142) ✅
   - Tests across all unit modules fixed after field name standardization
   - Override Service tests all fixed and passing (11/11 tests)

   - Scenario Service tests all fixed (8/8 tests)
   - ✅ Fixed batch_import_functionality tests (6/6 passing)
   - ✅ Fixed NFL Data Import Service tests, including calculate_season_totals robustness for empty/missing fields

## Next Steps for Test Fixes

   - ✅ Fixed override routes and service tests (19/19)
   - ✅ Fixed projections routes tests (11/11)
   - ✅ Fixed scenario routes tests (10/10)
   - ✅ Fixed scenario service tests (8/8)
   - ✅ Fixed NFL data import service test (calculate_season_totals)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **API integration issues**: If the nfl_data_py API changes, check for column mapping mismatches. We've made the adapter robust to handle common field changes.

2. **Database schema changes**: When adding new fields to models, remember to recreate the database or use migration tools.

3. **Memory issues**: For large imports, use the batch commit feature we've added (commits every 100 records) or the position-by-position import approach.

4. **Missing relationships**: The foreign key relationships have been set up correctly, but always verify player IDs exist before importing related stats.

5. **Team data limitations**: Currently using synthetic team stats - consider implementing a more accurate data source for team statistics in future updates.

6. **Field naming**: We've standardized on `rush_attempts` instead of `carries` throughout the codebase. If new tests are added, make sure they use the standardized field names.

7. **Python language issues**: Keep in mind that in Python, empty data structures like lists and dictionaries are truthy. Always check `if list_var and len(list_var) > 0:` if you need to check for empty vs. non-empty lists.

8. **Key error in calculations**: Always check if a key exists in a dictionary before trying to access it or use a default value with dict.get(). We've updated calculate_season_totals to properly handle missing or empty fields.

9. **ImportLog duplication**: The ImportLog model is defined twice in models.py, which can cause "table already exists" errors during initialization. This should be fixed by refactoring the model definitions.
