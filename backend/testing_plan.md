## Breaking Down the Large Test

Rather than trying to fix the complete_season_pipeline test directly, we've broken it down into smaller, focused component tests:

1. ✓ Veteran player projection tests - ALL PASSING
2. ✓ Rookie projection tests - ALL PASSING
3. ✓ Team adjustment tests - ALL PASSING
4. ✓ Scenario tests - ALL PASSING
5. ✓ Override tests - ALL PASSING

This divide-and-conquer approach makes it easier to identify and fix specific issues. Once all components are working correctly, we can focus on integrating them in the complete pipeline test.

## Running Tests

Use the provided bash script to run specific test categories:

```bash
./tests/system/run_tests.sh veteran   # Run just veteran projection tests - PASSING
./tests/system/run_tests.sh rookie    # Run just rookie projection tests - PASSING
./tests/system/run_tests.sh team      # Run just team adjustment tests - PASSING
./tests/system/run_tests.sh scenario  # Run just scenario tests - PASSING
./tests/system/run_tests.sh override  # Run just override tests - PASSING
./tests/system/run_tests.sh components # Run all component tests
./tests/system/run_tests.sh pipeline  # Run the complete pipeline test
./tests/system/run_tests.sh e2e       # Run end-to-end flow tests
./tests/system/run_tests.sh import    # Run import/export process tests
```

To run NFL data import tests specifically (requires nfl_data_py package):

```bash
# NFL data import unit tests
python -m pytest "tests/unit/test_nfl_data_import_service.py" -v

# NFL data integration tests
python -m pytest "tests/integration/test_nfl_data_integration.py" -v 

# Complete season pipeline with NFL data import
python -m pytest "tests/system/test_complete_season_pipeline.py" -v
```

## Test Data Management
- Create comprehensive test fixtures
- Use realistic sample datasets
- Maintain separation between test and production data

## Continuous Integration
- Run unit tests on every PR
- Run integration tests nightly
- Run system tests before releases
- Track and report coverage trends

## Test Tooling
- pytest for test execution
- pytest-asyncio for async testing
- pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- Mock for unit test isolation

## Test Fixture Strategy
- Create base fixtures for database and test data
- Use factory patterns for generating test entities
- Implement scoped fixtures to optimize performance
- Use parametrized tests for comprehensive test coverage

## API Integration Testing Approach
Our approach to API testing is to use integration tests that test the full application stack:

1. We use the pytest fixture system to create a test version of the full application
2. A test client fixture connects to the test application
3. Database fixtures create test data
4. Tests verify full API flows rather than isolated routes
5. We focus on data integrity and response validation

This approach provides better test coverage for real-world usage patterns and is more maintainable than isolated unit tests for each API route.
