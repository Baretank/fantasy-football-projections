# Fantasy Football Projections v0.3.0 Implementation Status

- See v0.2.0 snapshot [0.2.0 Snapshot](docs/versions/0.2.0/020_snapshot.md)

## Completed Functionality

### Core Infrastructure (Phases 1-4)
- ✅ Database schema with season-based organization and proper indexes
- ✅ Season-aware data models including BaseStat, TeamStat, and GameStats
- ✅ API endpoints with comprehensive season filtering
- ✅ Robust error handling and data validation throughout the system
- ✅ Enhanced type safety with TypedDict definitions and safe utility functions
- ✅ Advanced statistical projection engine with regression algorithms
- ✅ Target share and usage calculations for all positions
- ✅ "Fill player" mechanism for team statistical consistency
- ✅ Scenario system with cloning and comparison functionality
- ✅ Team-level statistical validation

### Frontend Improvements (Phase 5)
- ✅ Global season selector with context provider and localStorage persistence
- ✅ Completely redesigned Dashboard with:
  - Position-aware column system with dynamic statistics
  - Comprehensive player statistics display
  - Proper formatting and color-coding for all metrics
  - Optimized horizontal scrolling with sticky columns
  - Enhanced table styling with custom scrollbars
- ✅ API integration with proper loading states and error handling
- ✅ DraftDayTool with support for 2025 projections
- ✅ Player comparison and visualization features

### Phase 6: Player Data Optimization 
   - ✅ Fixed database query to remove arbitrary player limit and return all relevant players
   - ✅ Implemented filtering logic to handle different status codes in the database
   - ✅ Added client-side player position filtering to show only fantasy-relevant positions (QB, RB, WR, TE)
   - ✅ Created database index for player relevance to improve query performance
   - ✅ Integrated data/active_players.csv via ActivePlayerService to filter out inactive players in 2025 projections
   - ✅ Updated the data import pipeline with active player filtering in DataImportService, QueryService, and ProjectionService

## Remaining Priorities

### High Priority
- ✅ Fix player database query limitation to return all relevant players instead of only the first 100 alphabetically
- ✅ Add validation to filter out irrelevant players not on current teams from projections (Implemented Active Player Service using data/active_players.csv)
- Improve "fill player" functionality to maintain perfect statistical consistency
- Create export functionality for current projections
- Address bare except clauses with specific exception handling

### Medium Priority
- Implement statistical regression algorithm for projection smoothing
- Create enhanced comparison system between historical and projected efficiency
- Add team offensive style metrics to existing team_stats
- Optimize queries for aggregated season data
- Fix module resolution issues for mypy type checking

### Low Priority
- Add documentation generation from type annotations
- Plan for potential PostgreSQL migration

## Next Steps

### Phase 7: Quality of Life Improvements ✅
   - ✅ Enhanced Active Player Service to support more players and include season-aware filtering
   - ✅ Added different filtering logic for historical seasons (2023, 2024) to include players with real stats
   - ✅ Improved current season (2025) filtering to use strict active roster matching while maintaining reasonable player coverage
   - ✅ Added better error handling and logging throughout player filtering logic
   - ✅ Added position filtering to limit results to fantasy-relevant positions (QB, RB, WR, TE)
   - ✅ Updated QueryService to respect season selection (2023/2024 shows historical data, 2025 shows current players)
   - ✅ Enhanced ActivePlayerService to use more flexible name matching for current season players
   - ✅ Added explicit season parameter to API calls from frontend components
   - ✅ Improved ActivePlayerService with advanced player matching to handle variations in player names
   - ✅ Enhanced QueryService to always apply season parameter for proper filtering
   - ✅ Updated dashboard UI to clearly indicate whether viewing current or historical season
   - ⏳ Optimize player data fetching with smarter loading indicators
   - ⏳ Implement player data caching to reduce API calls
   - ⏳ Add sorting memory to maintain table state between sessions
   - ⏳ Create quick filters for common player groupings

### Phase 8: Export Functionality
   - Add API endpoints for exporting projections in various formats
   - Create frontend interface for data exports
   - Implement batch download capabilities

### Phase 9: Statistical Refinement
   - Complete team-level validation system
   - Finish efficiency metrics calculations
   - Implement projection variance analysis

### Phase 10: Documentation Updates
   - Create comprehensive user guide
   - Document API endpoints thoroughly
   - Add developer documentation for new features

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- ✅ Added database index for fantasy-relevant player queries
- Implement batch operations for bulk updates
- Add caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize statistical calculations

### Code Quality
- Complete mypy configuration for strict type checking
- Address any remaining linting issues
- Add comprehensive logging

## Key Files for Season-Aware & Active Player Filtering

### Backend
- **backend/services/active_player_service.py** - Core service for filtering active players with season-aware logic
- **backend/services/query_service.py** - Database query service that applies season and active player filtering
- **backend/api/routes/players.py** - API routes that accept season parameter and pass to services
- **backend/database/models.py** - Database models for players and projections
- **data/active_players.csv** - List of active players for current season (2025) filtering

### Frontend
- **frontend/src/services/api.ts** - API client that passes season parameter to backend
- **frontend/src/components/dashboard.tsx** - Main dashboard component that displays season-specific player data
- **frontend/src/components/ui/season-selector.tsx** - Season selection component
- **frontend/src/context/SeasonContext.tsx** - Season context provider for application-wide season state
- **frontend/src/utils/calculatioms.ts** - Utilities for season determination and calculations

### Key Implementation Notes
- Season-aware filtering applies different logic based on season:
  - **2023-2024 (Historical)**: Show players with fantasy points > 0
  - **2025 (Current)**: Filter by active_players.csv roster using flexible name matching
- Player name matching uses multiple strategies:
  - Exact name matching for precise results
  - Last name + team matching for handling name variations
- Fantasy-relevant positions (QB, RB, WR, TE) are filtered at both backend and frontend levels
- UI clearly indicates which season's data is being shown
